This is the file INSTALL for the xwpe distribution, version 1.5.11a.

IMPORTANT NOTE:  The configuration file format has changed since version
1.5.10a.  Old configuration files will not work.

To compile this package:

1.  Configure the package for your system.  In the directory that this
file is in, type `./configure'.  If you're using `csh' on an old
version of System V, you might need to type `sh configure' instead to
prevent `csh' from trying to execute `configure' itself.

The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation, and
creates the Makefile. It also creates a file `config.status'
that you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration.

Running `configure' takes a minute or two.  While it is running, it
prints some messages that tell what it is doing.

By default, xwpe files will be installed in the /usr/local directories.
You can specify an installation prefix other than /usr/local by giving
`configure' the option `--prefix=PATH'.

If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, we encourage
you to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and
mail diffs or instructions to the address given in the README so we
can include them in the next release.

2.  Type `make' to compile the package.

3.  Type `make install' to install programs, data files, and
documentation. (For german-speaking people: Type `make install_german'
to install programs, data files and german documentation)

4.  You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
source directory by typing `make clean'.
