                          XWPE ALPHA README


What is xwpe?

     Xwpe is a development environment designed for use on UNIX
systems.  Fred Kruse wrote xwpe and released the software for free
under the GNU Public License.  The user interface was designed to
mimic the Borland C and Pascal family.  Extensive support is provided
for programming.
     Syntax highlighting for many programming languages are included
and others may be added if necessary.  Any compiler can easily be
used by the program.  By compiling within xwpe, errors in the source
code can be jumped to and swiftly corrected.  Support for three
different debuggers are provided within the development environment.
Variables and the stack can be easily displayed.  Setting and
unsetting breakpoints can done directly within the source code.
     The program can be run in several forms.  Xwpe runs the X
windows version of the programming environment.  Wpe simply runs a
terminal programming environment.  Xwe and we provide a simple text
editor for X windows and terminal modes respectively.
     On-line help describes the complete use of xwpe.

What is xwpe-alpha?
     The xwpe-alpha project is an attempt to reorganize the source code to
improve readability.  It will also incorporate as many bug fixes as
available.  Attempts to contact the author of xwpe have received no
response so xwpe-alpha should be considered unsupported by Fred Kruse.
To signify the difference xwpe-alpha has increased the version number
from 1.4.x to 1.5.x despite relatively few changes at present.  Also
xwpe-alpha release end in 'a' (e.g. 1.5.4a).

Why release it now?
     The source code is still largely unchanged at this point.  The purpose
in the release is to discover problems early in the modifications.  Since
not all platforms are accessible to the developers come changes could
inadvertently break compilation on another system.  Also understanding and
modifying the structure of xwpe is a large undertaking and will take a long
time to complete.
