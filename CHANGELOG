Notes for Hackers
     Conditional compilation can quickly destroy the readability of source
code.  Non-ANSI C conditional compilation have been removed for the sake of
clarity.  We are sorry if this causes problems for anyone.  In the future
xwpe alpha may begin to use POSIX functions in preference to others as
well.
     All support for dos has been removed.  It has not worked in the
last official release and there is not really a need for it.  No one is
actively working on the djgpp port which also didn't work in the last Fred
Kruse release.  The djgpp defines are slowly being removed since no support
is likely in the near future.

German Documentation
     All German documentation has been moved to the old directory as no one
has updated it since 1.4.2.


Known Bugs

* Debugging leaks memory (actually location of the leak unknown).
* Documentation hasn't been updated.
* Compilers are assumed to have a -c and -o option.
* 'make install' installs x versions even if not compiled in.
* Adding items when no project is open has odd behavior.
* Changing the maximum column and using cut & paste can crash xwpe.
* Clicking "edit" in the project menu when not on a file it loads a file
     with a name of " ".
* Esc key requires 3 presses to do the regular escape function under Linux
     console (and perhaps other terminal types).
* No error for disk full.
* Check headers doesn't correctly handle comments and "ifndef" protection.
* Debugger assumes the program starts in "main".
* Certain file names like 'Messages' aren't handled properly.
* Cursor keys don't work in xterms or telnet sessions.

     dialogs.

     expressions for matching and replacing.  Ctrl-F1 now looks up the
     current function.

1.5.12a
* Added Brian's patch to only allow a file to be loaded once in an earlier
     version but forgot to record it.  This version includes some fixes
     to that since it wasn't working.
* Added Yarick Rastrigin's tab patch.  Doesn't allow tabbing through
     buttons but a welcome improvement (particularly for the replace dialog).

     from file manager and the "edit" now loads the file for editing.

     support DJGPP in the near future.

1.5.10a
* Fixed long filenames from crashing xwpe when the window is shrunk.
* Added Duane Penzien's wastebasket delete bug fix.  Should probably display

     now appears near the bottom left.  The asterisk disappears when the file
     is saved instead of poping up a message box.

1.5.8a
* Fixed gzipped man page bug.
* Directory can no longer be loaded as files but it doesn't display an error
     message.

* Incorporated more changes from Stefan Hille.
* Removed some warnings.

1.5.4a
* Changed naming from ALPHA-x to 1.5.xa.  The change from 1.4 to 1.5a does
     not represent a great change in functionality instead marks the change
     of maintainers
* Removed all remenents of dos support.
* Added some changes from Stefan Hille such as messages.h.
* Changed handling of expose event under X Window so that it only redraws
     part of the screen.
* Added Java syntax to the syntax definition file.
* Deciphered purpose of the help.key (formally we_help_str) file.  This file
     gives the section of help that should be loaded while xwpe is in
     different states.  Each line corresponds to a mode.  The modes are as
     follows:
       1  - Standard file                14 - Project menu
       2  - Watch window                 15 - Option menu
       3  - Stack window                 16 - Window menu
       4  - Message window               17 - Help menu
       5  - Most file-manager windows    18 - Function-Index window
       6  - Execute file-manager window  19 - Grep window
       7  - System (#) menu              20 - Find window
       8  - File menu                    21 - Project window
       9  - Edit menu                    22 - Variables window
       10 - Search menu                  23 - Install window
       11 - Block menu                   24 - Windows window
       12 - Run menu                     25 - Top menu bar
       13 - Debug menu                   26 - Help window

ALPHA-3
* Fixed bug in WeExpArr.c
* Fixed debugging problem found by Oliver Wilson.
* Several other minor cleanups throughout the code.
* Some documentation fixes as well.
* Removed support for encrypted files (if enough people request it, the
     encrypted file support could be added again but for the time being we
     feel this is not needed in a development environment).

ALPHA-2
* Fixed bug in syntax highlighting for FORTRAN.
* Lots of old code that had been commented out were removed.
* Some functions from we_progn.c have been renamed and moved to WeSyntax.c
* Renamed all configuration files.
* Changed format of syntax_def (formerly we_synt_def).  This will almost
     certainly change again since the current format is difficult to use.
* Documentation plan:
     1) INSTALL - all compiling instructions and installation needs (not
          started)
     2) README - simply states what the program does (not started)
     3) xwpe.1 - describes configuration files and command line options
          (mostly done)
     4) help.xwpe - on-line documentation describing all use (command line
           options updated but not configuration files and anything else)

ALPHA-1
* All patches were applied except the gpm patch.
* SWAP and NOWEUNDO have been removed since they don't work.
* Some other defines have been removed as well.
* Some functions from we_hfkt.c have been renamed and moved to WeString.c
* Some functions from we_xterm.c have been renamed and moved to WeXterm.c
* Modified X resources a lot making the documentation incorrect.
